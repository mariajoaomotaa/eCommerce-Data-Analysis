### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the overall perfomance of this fictional company, with emphasis in analysing the year of 2024.


### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "transactions.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- postgreSQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports and visualizing the results


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

This project involved exploring the sales fictional data to answer some possible key questions, such as:

- What is the most profitable product category?
- What are the peak sales periods?
- Where are we exporting the most to?
- What is the age group we should cater more in the future?


### Limitations

Because they're not real, the values of the products' sales and revenue don't differ significantly from each other, creating an almost 'perfect' revenue scenario, specially since the categories are substancially distinct.
